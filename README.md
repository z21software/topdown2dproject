# topdown2dproject-study

Joining the 150 days challenge. In this project you will see my progress in learning C# & Unity

Second day:
- Added simple enemies, they can hit player and decrease the score. If score = 0 and player hits enemy -> both die
- Added some visual effects
- Refactor few parts of code..It's still not good.
Next day will add new features, rework AI and refactore all remaining parts of code
